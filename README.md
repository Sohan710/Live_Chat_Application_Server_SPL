- IntelliJ/VS-Code will download the dependencies
- Run Application.kt file

# Key Features and Components:
- Leveraging MongoDB to store messages exchanged between different users. Ensuring proper indexing and efficient querying is crucial for quick access to chat histories. This feature enhances user experience by retaining chat history across sessions and devices.
- Leveraging MongoDB for message storage aligns with a scalable architecture. MongoDB's NoSQL nature allows for efficient horizontal scaling, accommodating a growing user base and increased message traffic 
- Assessed the database's performance under varying loads, including inserting, retrieving, and updating messages.
- Analyzed database performance metrics while simulating different user activities.
- Inserting Messages: Store new messages in the MongoDB database.
- Retrieving Messages: Fetch chat history for display.
- MongoDB exhibited scalable performance, efficiently handling message storage operations across varying loads.
- MongoDB maintained stable performance, with read and write operations scaling well with increased user interactions.
- The scalable architecture, particularly leveraging MongoDB for message storage, ensures that the app can accommodate a growing user base and increased message traffic.
